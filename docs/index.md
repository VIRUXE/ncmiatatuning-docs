# NC Miata Tuning - RomDrop Edition

![](/images/image128.png)

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for tuning your NC Miata using RomDrop. RomDrop is a powerful tool that allows you to read, modify, and write the ECU's ROM, giving you control over your car's performance.

This documentation wouldn't exist without the incredible work of Speeps, who single-handedly reverse-engineered the NC ECU and developed RomDrop. Special thanks to Kwheels, VTECKiller, Shifty35, and NyxOne for their contributions and support.

Before diving in, please take a moment to read the [READ ME (seriously)](/read-me-seriously) section. It contains important information and resources that will help you get the most out of this guide.
