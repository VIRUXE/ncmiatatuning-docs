Assuming your car is running fine and you followed [Before you start](/before-you-start), here's how I recommend getting started with tuning your NC Miata:

* Patch your ROM with [RomDrop](/tools-of-the-trade/romdrop) using [EcuFlash](/tools-of-the-trade/ecuflash).
* Flash your newly patched ROM to your ECU using EcuFlash.
* Datalog your car's baseline performance using a properly configured [logcfg.txt](/data-logging/logcfg-txt) with your Tactrix OpenPort 2.
* Visualize and analyze your logs with [Mega Log Viewer HD](/tools-of-the-trade/mega-log-viewer-hd).
* Estimate your car's power output with [Virtual Dyno](/tools-of-the-trade/virtual-dyno).
* Start making small, intentional changes to your tune based on your goals (e.g., power, efficiency, or reliability).
* Datalog after every change to confirm the effects and ensure stability.
* Repeat the process, refining your tune over time.

Start simpleâ€”focus on understanding your stock setup before chasing big power gains. Tuning is iterative, so patience and data are your best friends.
