This section dives into the nitty-gritty of tuning your NC Miata's ECU with RomDrop, offering detailed guides for specific modifications and performance goals. Whether you're optimizing air-fuel ratios, adjusting spark timing, or setting up a forced induction system, these guides provide step-by-step instructions tailored to common tuning scenarios.

Here's what's covered:

- **[Load Scaling](/tuning/specific-tunes/load-scaling)**: Adjusting load tables for accurate ECU calculations.
- **[AFR Tuning](/tuning/specific-tunes/afr-tuning)**: Fine-tuning air-fuel ratios for power or efficiency.
- **[VCT / VVT Tuning](/tuning/specific-tunes/vct-tuning)**: Optimizing variable cam timing for performance.
- **[Spark / Ignition Timing Tuning](/tuning/specific-tunes/spark-timing-tuning)**: Setting ignition timing for maximum power and safety.
- **[IMTV Tuning](/tuning/specific-tunes/imtuning)**: Configuring the Intake Manifold Tuning Valve.
- **[CAMs](/tuning/specific-tunes/cams)**: Tuning for aftermarket camshafts.
- **[2.5 Swap](/tuning/specific-tunes/25-swap)**: Adapting the ECU for a 2.5L engine swap.
- **[Flex Fuel](/tuning/specific-tunes/flex-fuel)**: Setting up for ethanol blends.
- **[Forced Induction](/tuning/specific-tunes/forced-induction)**: Tuning for turbo or supercharger setups.

## Overview

Each guide in this section focuses on a specific aspect of ECU tuning, building on the basics from [Getting Started](/tuning/getting-started). These are hands-on tutorials for intermediate to advanced tuners looking to achieve precise control over their NC Miata's performance. From stock engines to heavily modified setups, you'll find the knowledge here to make your tune sing.

## Where to Start

If you're new to these topics, review [Getting Started](/tuning/getting-started) first to grasp the fundamentals. Then, pick the guide that matches your projectâ€”[AFR Tuning](/tuning/specific-tunes/afr-tuning) is a great starting point for most, while [Forced Induction](/tuning/specific-tunes/forced-induction) suits those with boost. Use these guides alongside data from [Data Logging](/data-logging) to refine your results.
