# Automotive Terms and Acronyms

---

## A
**APP**: Accelerator Pedal Position  
**AFR**: Air:Fuel Ratio  

## C
**CL**: Closed Loop  
**CPP**: Clutch Pedal Position  

## D
**DBW**: Drive by Wire  

## E
**ECT**: Engine Coolant Temperature  
**ECU**: Engine Control Unit  
**EGR**: Exhaust Gas Recirculation  

## F
**FT**: Fuel trims  

## H
**High det**: High detonation tables are used if the ECU senses too much knock, e.g., when using fuel with a lower octane rating such as 87.  

## I
**IAT**: Intake Air Temperature  
**IDC**: Injector Duty Cycle  
**IMRC**: Intake Manifold Runner Control (Automatic only)  
**IMTV**: Intake Manifold Tumbler Valve  
**IPW**: Injector Pulse Width  

## L
**Limp mode**: A safety feature where the ECU restricts engine performance to prevent damage when it detects a serious problem. Typically results in reduced power, limited RPM, and illuminated check engine light.  
**Low det**: Low detonation tables are used when the ECU senses few to no knock events, e.g., when using good fuel with an octane rating of 91 or more.  
**LTFT**: Long Term Fuel Trim  

## M
**MAF**: Mass Air Flow [sensor]  
**MAP**: Manifold Absolute Pressure  

## O
**OL**: Open Loop  

## S
**STFT**: Short Term Fuel Trim  

## V
**VCT/VVT**: Variable Cam Timing/Variable Valve Timing (Used interchangeably)  

## W
**WIP**: Work in Progress  
**WOT**: Wide Open Throttle
