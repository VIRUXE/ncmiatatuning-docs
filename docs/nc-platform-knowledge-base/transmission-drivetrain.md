| With the NC2 (Mk3.5) upgrade revisions in 2009, there were some changes to the 6-speed gearbox to improve performance. This later gearbox features a new carbon coating on the 1st through 4th gear synchros and larger diameter synchros on 3rd and 4th gear to further improve the shift feel and action. The trim level names also changed with the base model becoming "SE" and the previous Sport changing to "Sport Tech" or "Sport Tech Nav" if you wanted one with an integrated navigation system. A 6-speed automatic gearbox option was introduced as the "PowerShift" models. The final drive ratio for the 1.8 SE was changed to a 3.9. Also note that with the second facelift (NC3), the 2.0 5-speed SE model was phased out and no longer available. |

| That about covers the UK cars, but what about Japan? Well the important thing to note here is that the 1.8 litre engine doesn't exist. Great, that makes my table much simpler. Also, there are a few differences between the UK 6-speed manual gearbox and the Japanese version so I've included an extra column for comparison. I'm not sure why the first three gears in the JDM 6-speed are different, but the difference in final drive between UK and Japan is likely to do with highway speed limits and acceptable revs at motorway speeds. |

| The facelifts in Japan had some minor changes to the lineup with the base model now being referred to as the S, and of course there are the RHT (Retractable Hard Top) variants with some models disappearing such as the soft top VS. The only real change of note is a revised taller 6th gear for the manual 6-speed that was also used in the USA but we didn't get in the UK, meaning the two different 6-speed boxes share only 4th, 5th, and reverse. Again I've included a UK comparison column below. |
