# Data Logging for NC Miata Tuning

Data logging is a critical step in tuning your NC Miata with RomDrop. It allows you to monitor your car's performance, identify areas for improvement, and validate your tuning changes. This section covers everything you need to know to set up, configure, and troubleshoot data logging on your NC Miata.

Here's what's included:

- **[The MicroSD Card](/data-logging/microsd-card)**: Using a MicroSD card for onboard logging.
- **[OpenPort Logging Configuration (logcfg.txt)](/data-logging/logcfg-txt)**: Setting up your OpenPort cable with a custom configuration file.
- **[Calculated Fields](/data-logging/calculated-fields)**: Creating custom metrics from logged data.
- **[Mode 23](/data-logging/mode-23)**: Understanding and using Mode 23 for advanced logging.
- **[Triggers](/data-logging/triggers)**: Configuring triggers to start and stop logging automatically.
- **[Monitoring External Sensors](/data-logging/external-sensors)**: Integrating additional sensors into your logs.
- **[Troubleshooting](/data-logging/troubleshooting)**: Resolving common logging issues.

## Overview

Effective tuning relies on accurate data. With RomDrop and an OpenPort cable, you can log real-time data from your ECU, such as air-fuel ratios, knock counts, and throttle position. This section walks you through the process, from hardware setup (like the MicroSD card) to advanced techniques (like Mode 23 logging), ensuring you can capture the data needed to optimize your NC Miata's performance.

## Getting Started

Begin with [The MicroSD Card](/data-logging/microsd-card) to set up onboard logging, then configure your logging parameters in [OpenPort Logging Configuration (logcfg.txt)](/data-logging/logcfg-txt). Once you're logging, explore [Calculated Fields](/data-logging/calculated-fields) and [Mode 23](/data-logging/mode-23) to enhance your data analysis. If you run into issues, check out [Troubleshooting](/data-logging/troubleshooting) for solutions.
