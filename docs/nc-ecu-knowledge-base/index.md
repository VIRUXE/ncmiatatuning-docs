# NC ECU Knowledge Base

This section delves into the inner workings of the NC Miata's Engine Control Unit (ECU), providing the technical foundation you need to master tuning with RomDrop. Understanding how the ECU operates is essential for making informed adjustments to your car's performance.

Here's what you'll find:

- **[Base Fuel Target](/nc-ecu-knowledge-base/base-fuel-target)**: How the ECU determines fuel delivery.
- **[Spark Maps](/nc-ecu-knowledge-base/spark-maps)**: Understanding ignition timing tables.
- **[How to Calculate Spark Timing](/nc-ecu-knowledge-base/calculate-spark-timing)**: Methods for setting ignition timing.
- **[Knock Detection Strategy](/nc-ecu-knowledge-base/knock-detection)**: How the ECU detects and responds to knock.
- **[Drive Status Modes](/nc-ecu-knowledge-base/drive-status-modes)**: Overview of ECU operating modes.
- **[Math and Formulas](/nc-ecu-knowledge-base/math-and-formulas)**: Key calculations behind ECU tuning.

## Overview

The NC Miata's ECU controls everything from fuel injection to ignition timing, making it the brain of your car's performance. RomDrop unlocks this brain, and this knowledge base explains the logic and mechanics behind its operations. From fuel targets to knock protection, these pages equip you with the theory to complement the practical guides in [Tuning](/tuning).

## How to Use This Section

This is your reference for ECU specifics. Check [Base Fuel Target](/nc-ecu-knowledge-base/base-fuel-target) and [Spark Maps](/nc-ecu-knowledge-base/spark-maps) to understand stock behavior, then use [How to Calculate Spark Timing](/nc-ecu-knowledge-base/calculate-spark-timing) and [Math and Formulas](/nc-ecu-knowledge-base/math-and-formulas) to plan your adjustments. Pair this with [Data Logging](/data-logging) to verify your changes.
