These are the stock tables for a 2.5L and their purpose is to serve as a reference. Thanks to

## **Load scaling table**

## **Fuel Closed loop**

Note: Both low det and high det tables are identical.

## **Spark base - High fuel request - Low det**

After digging around and asking question it turns out MBT on at **STOCK** (including cams) at full load is around 24-25* which should technically be achievable on 93 and even 91.

Note: a cammed engine will have a different timing.

These values were observed by albuquerquefx Mazda 6 2.5L on 93 octane

## **Spark base - High fuel request - Hit det**

These values were observed by albuquerquefx Mazda 6 2.5L on 87 octane

Apparently this one is from Mazda 3 and the first table would be for CL and the second for OL.
