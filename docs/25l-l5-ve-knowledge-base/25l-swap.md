## **Mechanical notes**

### **Port matching the aluminum MX5 intake runners to the 2.5L head**

Long story short there's no benefit.

*For all the guys who have been wondering about the benefits from port matching the aluminum MX5 intake runners to the 2.5L headâ€¦*  
*We just did a back to back test today .*  
*Red = not matched*  
*Black = welded & port matched*  
*Both manifold setups were run with the same ignition advance as well as a pretty darn close fuel curve as you can see in the AFR chart.  The mapping is not set on kill, it's setup so it can be repeatable for testing.*  
*Hope you all enjoy data!*
